"How is it possible that a being with such sensitive jewels as the eyes, such enchanted musical instruments as the ears, and such a fabulous arabesque of nerves as the brain can experience itself as anything less than a god? And, when you consider that this incalculably subtle organism is inseparable from the still more marvelous patterns of its environment--from the minutest electrical designs to the whole company of the galaxies--how is it conceivable that this incarnation of all eternity can be bored with being?",
"You need the tiniest bit of bravery.",
